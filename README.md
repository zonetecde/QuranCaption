# Quran Caption — AI-Powered Quranic Video Editor

**Quran Caption** is a modern Quranic video editor designed to help you create high-quality
recitation videos with subtitles, translations, and advanced visual styling — powered by AI.

With its refined interface, optimized algorithms, and hundreds of customization options, Quran
Caption makes it simple and fast to produce unique Quran recitation videos, easily shareable on
platforms like **YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram**.

## AI-Powered Features

Quran Caption integrates **artificial intelligence** to drastically reduce manual work and speed up
the entire creation workflow — from subtitles to translations.

### Automatic Audio & Video Segmentation

- **Automatic subtitle generation using AI** from an audio or video recitation.
- Supports:
  - Mid-verse cuts
  - Silence detection
  - Basmala detection
  - Istiʿādha detection

### AI-Assisted Translation

- **AI-assisted translation trimming** when a verse is cut in the middle.
- When subtitles are split or partially selected, the **translation is automatically adjusted** to
  match the exact spoken segment.
- This ensures translations stay **accurate, aligned, and natural**, even with mid-verse cuts.
- Manual review is always possible, keeping full control in the editor.

Together, these features mean **no more manual subtitle placement and far less manual translation
editing** — you focus on review and fine-tuning instead of repetitive work.
