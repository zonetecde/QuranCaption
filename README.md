# Quran Caption — Quranic Video Editor

I am pleased to announce, after months of hard work, that Quran Caption 3 is now officially available to the public.

With its brand-new interface, refined algorithms, and hundreds of customization options, Quran Caption 3 makes it simple and fast to create unique Quran recitation videos — easily shareable on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.

Quran Caption is the result of countless hours of coding, debugging, and testing — but above all, it is the fruit of the continuous support and collaboration of the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/Hxfqq2QA2J). I sincerely thank everyone who helped bring this project to life, and I pray that Allah grants them ḥasanāt for every video generated and viewed through this software.

🌙 Don’t wait any longer — download Quran Caption 3 today!
