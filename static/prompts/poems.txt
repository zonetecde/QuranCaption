**Task**:
Format Arabic poems with translations into a structured JSON format.

Ensure the output is a JSON object with a specific structure, including verse numbers, Arabic text, and translations if available.

Follow these guidelines:
1. **Input**: A string containing the raw text of the poem, which may include various translations in different languages.
2. **Output**: A JSON object with the following structure:
    ```json
    {
        "verses": [
            {
                "number": 1,
                "text": "(in arabic)",
                "translations" : {
                    "language_code "...",
                    "phonetics": "..." // if included in the raw text
                }
            }  
        ]
    }
    ```
3. **Verse Numbering**: Each verse should be numbered sequentially, starting from 1 OR if precised from the number given in the raw text.
4. **Arabic Text**: The Arabic text of each verse should be included in the "text" field. If the verses are in 2 separated sentences (typical Arabic poems), like "مُحَمَّدٌ يَوْمَ بَعْثِ النَّاسِ شَافِعُنَا *** مُحَمَّدٌ نُورُهُ الْهَادِي مِنَ الظُّلَمِ" add a *** between them.
Please ensure that the Arabic text is properly formatted and that each verse is complet. Remember that in arabic poetry, a verse is in a lot of cases composed of two sub-verse separated by the "***" string.
5. **Translations**: If the poem includes translations, they should be included in the "translations" field. Use as key the language code.
6. **Phonetics**: If the poem includes phonetic transcriptions, they should be included in the translation field as well, with the key "phonetics".
